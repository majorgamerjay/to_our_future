<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; It&#8217;s dark. The lights are
turned off. The room is cold. There&#8217;s no one here. I don&#8217;t
know what happened. Five minutes ago, I was outside, now I
am in a cold room with heavy air. I am sweating. the door is
right in front of me. I know it&#8217;s not locked.</p>

<p>I muster up all my courage and go to the door; Once I twist
the doorknob, I get a feeling of strong wind pushing me on
the other side. There must be a storm outside, once I open
the door completely; I was shocked&#8230;</p>

<p>I am in an alley. Buildings in front of me are in rubbles.
It&#8217;s broken; as if it&#8217;s been broken for the last few
years. I look behind me and what I see is the backdoor of a
convenience store. So that can only mean, I woke up in a
storage room. I start asking myself questions,</p>

<p><em>What happened here? Where is everybody? Where am I?</em></p>

<p>I look for a sign. I need to find out where I am no matter
what. <em>Please help me God.</em> I keep saying this to myself.</p>
