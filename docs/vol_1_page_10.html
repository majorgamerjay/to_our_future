<p>When the police arrived, we took them to the bathroom. They
could see a lot of blood coming from under the bathroom door
but this is strange. We don&#8217;t remember the guy was bleeding,
we only knocked him out.</p>

<p>When they opened the door, it was a shocking sight. There
was no more of him left, all of his body somehow transformed
into blood and liquid organs.</p>

<p>It was all spilling from the latex-like clothes the guy was
wearing. We couldn&#8217;t see his face because he wore a black
mask of the same texture but, now I could see his organs
from the inside slowly disintegrating.</p>

<p>The sight was so shocking, I held my friend Rashed&#8217;s hand
and he strongly held mine. This would be traumatizing for
anybody. The police didn&#8217;t know what to do.</p>

<p>The next day, the university authorities were informed of
the incident and we were told not to tell anybody about it.
They also took this incident being traumatizing for all of
us into consideration and gave us a 4 weeks leave and
assigned us to visit a psychologist twice per week.</p>
