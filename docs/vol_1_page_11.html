<p><em>Sarah&#8230; Why her?</em></p>

<p>I was at home at that time; in Gomopuri. Although the
University counselor told me to not think about it anymore
because it will get me more traumatized and stressed, but
how the heck can I not think about such a horrifying
incident?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not like I can just magically forget about it like the
Morty Mind-blower thing in Rick and Morty, that weirdo
cartoon series that I watched as a kid or like the small pen
thing from Men in Black.</p>

<p><em>That creepy giggle</em></p>

<p>Another thing that I couldn&#8217;t get out of my head was the
creepy giggle of that guy. I know I have this bad habit of
giggling out of context but that guy.. I couldn&#8217;t get that
giggle out of my head. I just want to forget all this and go
to sleep.</p>
