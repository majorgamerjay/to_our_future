<p><em>*Knock knock*</em></p>

<p>My heart skipped a beat. Someone knocked at my door.
I get shocked now and then about mere stuff. Even when
someone knocks my door suddenly. Mostly because of that
incident.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in!&#8221; I shouted</p>

<p>&#8220;Ree!!&#8221; Came in my two siblings, Raima and Zaima.</p>

<p>Both are twins. They are hella cute. If I could I would keep
poking at their cheeks for the whole day but that would be
weird and embarrassing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vaiya, open this chips packet for me&#8221;, Raima brought a
packet of potato chips with her. Since they are both 6 years
old, they still can&#8217;t open a packet of chips properly. I
opened it up for them and took a piece.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey that&#8217;s unfair!&#8221; Zaima told me when I took a piece.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop whining Zaima, it&#8217;s fair because I am the one who
opened the packet&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re an old guy!&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Sheesh, can&#8217;t believe I get called old more often now</em></p>
