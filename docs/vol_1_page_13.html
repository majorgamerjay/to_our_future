<p>After they left the room, I got on my PC. I can&#8217;t believe I
still have these wallpapers of semi-lewd anime girls. This
just reflects how much of a shut-in I was before going to
college.</p>

<p>I powered on my PC, it asked for a username and a password.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t stop cringing at myself. I knew I was cringe but at
this level? Thank God, I changed. I had a great
transformation at highschool thanks to a few people who took
pity on me. I still don&#8217;t consider them as friends because I
am sure they did all these just to take advantage of me when
I become successful in the future.</p>

<p>I am always skeptical about things and people. The only
people that I trusted in my life were my parents, my
siblings, my cousin, my uncle and Rashed. I had a crush on
Sarah when I saw her for the first time, but that quickly
got lifted away when she got a boyfriend sooner than I
thought.</p>

<p><em>Fuck fuck fuck.. I am so much fucking unlucky</em></p>
