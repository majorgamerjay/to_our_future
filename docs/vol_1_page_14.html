<p>I stopped having these nightmares I had back in dorm.</p>

<p><em>Is it because I had a real life incident that&#8217;s worse than
this nightmare?</em></p>

<p>I keep asking myself these stupid questions. This only
proves how worthless and insecure I am about my life. But I
don&#8217;t give a shit and I never gave a shit.</p>

<p><em>*Doorbell Rang*</em></p>

<p><em>We don&#8217;t usually have any guests at home, who could that be?</em></p>

<p>I look at the clock and it&#8217;s 3:23 PM. My mom is supposed to
bring tea but I&#8217;m not gonna open the door. Then I hear my
mom opening the door and telling the guest to sit on the
sofa in the living room.</p>

<p>My mom said he brought my tea to the living room because the
guest wants to meet me. I don&#8217;t like company and now I got a
guest.</p>

<p><em>How worse can my day get now?</em></p>

<p>I went to the living room and I was surprised.. It&#8217;s Rashed.</p>
