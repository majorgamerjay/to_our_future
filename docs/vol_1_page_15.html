<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When I thought that there
shouldn&#8217;t be any guests coming to our home today, I was
surprised and kinda happy to see Rashed. But,</p>

<p><em>Who the hell is this girl with him?</em></p>

<p>&#8220;Yo Sami, how have you been?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fine dude. You?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m alright. Haven&#8217;t seen you since the incident
occured.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mhm, the incident ticked everything off just like that.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>I know it will be rude if I don&#8217;t say anything to this
girl. So I give it a try.</em></p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, you are Rashed&#8217;s friend? I&#8217;m Shamiul&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi~ I&#8217;m Sumiha. I&#8217;m his girlfriend actually&#8221;</p>

<p><em>what.</em></p>

<p>&#8220;Ohh, that&#8217;s nice. How are you doing today?&#8221;</p>

<p>I cannot continue this conversation further while knowing
that my best friend just betrayed me. Broke my heart. Ruined
my life like this. All my love and trust into him.. all of
it.. are gone. <em>Poof</em> just like that.</p>
