<p>Well I do really want to ask him what brings him here. But
that would be rude and last thing I want is to lose a
friend like this. Should I ask or not? I&#8217;m in a dilemma
here.</p>

<p>&#8220;So what brings you here, Rashed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yeah, I came to told you about Sarah and to visit. I
heard you guys have really good <em>pithas</em> here.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Wait.. that was it? I thought it&#8217;s gonna be dramatic and
he&#8217;s gonna get mad at me. I also doubt you came here for that
you son of a bitch. You came here to flex your girlfriend, didn&#8217;t you?</em></p>

<p>&#8220;So how&#8217;s Sarah?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s good. Recovered mostly, the doctor said she will have
to stay for about 3 more weeks to fully recover. Oh, she
also said she&#8217;s very thankful to you for taking care of her
during that incident.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just my duty as a friend. No need for her to sweat
it.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Holy shit, did she really thank me?</em></p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be off then. Thanks for the tea and
refreshments. We got some touring to do.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Yeah, go on do your &#8220;touring&#8221; you bitch.</em></p>
