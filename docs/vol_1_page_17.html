<p>I heard my cousin Mostafa is going to get married. I guess
there is hope for that guy. He&#8217;s a shut-in like me but he
didn&#8217;t recover. He became internationally popular due to
his research papers about theoretical physics and got a lot
of money from organizations.</p>

<p>Cool thing about him is that he&#8217;s a gamer. Heard he recently
bought the new game called Ultra Strike: Global Fire. I&#8217;m
going to visit him to get some games and food.</p>

<p>When I passed by 55th Roman Road, I started getting nausea
and headaches. The convenience store over there always
reminds me about that nightmare.</p>

<p>My dad once told me this road was named Roman Road
because there used to live a lot of Romaboos here in the
18th century despite the Roman&#8217;s didn&#8217;t exist at that.
They praise their civilization, success and everything.</p>

<p>Like how Weaboos and Koreaboos exist, Romaboos exist. I
might get into this thing if someone who&#8217;s into Roman
supremacy can help me.</p>
