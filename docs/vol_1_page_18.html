<p>I stop at the local bus station and I pull out my phone.
First thing I see on Gwitter are pictures of Rashed and
his new girlfriend at the local tourist sites and food shop.</p>

<p><em>What a hypocrite..</em></p>

<p>Then, I felt something. Someone pulled something from my
backpocket. I look back and see a pickpocketer with my
wallet. I ran after him yelling everybody to stop him. He
started running very fast but in no way I am gonna lose my
Eid allowance.</p>

<p><strong><em>I WILL USE IT TO BUY ULTRA STRIKE: GLOBAL FIRE</em></strong></p>

<p>The pickpocketer ran into an alley. I know this place well
and that alley is a dead end. He fell into his own trap. But
at the same time I&#8217;m scared because what if the pickpocketer
has weapons? I am risking my life,</p>

<p><em>Should I go?</em></p>

<p>I opened my phone and dialed an emergency call to the police
about my location.</p>
