<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Here it is, I found it. I
found a signboard of a local bike store..</p>

<p><em>Hassan &#38; Friends&#8217; Bikes!</em></p>

<p>Hmm, this sounds like it&#8217;s from my country. Looking at the
bottom of the signboard to see the address, I was shocked
again.</p>

<p><em>55th Roman Road, Gomopuri, Bangladesh</em></p>

<p>This is my hometown&#8230;</p>

<p><em>How did this happen? Where is everybody? What time is it?
How long was I out?</em></p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t keep a hold of myself; My body starts shaking..
My life starts flashing before my eyes.. My hometown, my
parents, my childhood friends, my brother and everybody..
Where could they be? God, please give me an answer to this.
I lost my sense and fell on the back of my head.</p>

<p>Only to find out.. This was just a dream.
