<p>After that incident, I had stopped talking to almost
everybody unless there was an important reason to. I stopped
going outside. I stopped all my contacts with friends. I
became a shut-in.</p>

<p>I was going through a very hard time. My parents noticed
this and took me to a psychiatrist who gave me pills that
would slow down my brain reactions.</p>

<p>This is to &#8220;calm myself&#8221; but in reality, this didn&#8217;t
help me in any way. Soon I started having hallucinations
about things and I was always scared if what I see, becomes
real again.</p>

<p>This is why I kept myself at home most of the time as a kid
and a teen until I had to go to college.</p>
