<p><em>what?</em></p>

<p>When the lady from the so-called resistance said I need to
die, I was confused. But whatever it is, saving my life is now the
main priority.</p>

<p><em>Think Sami, think!</em></p>

<p>I remember calling the police on an emergency. The new
police reform after the anarchy episodes of the country
ended requires them to arrive at the emergency place within
five minutes of distress signal.</p>

<p>Three minutes should&#8217;ve passed at least. I just have to
distract her and..</p>

<p><em>*shot*</em></p>

<p>A bullet was shot through her chest from behind. I just saw a
person die from getting shot in front of me. Her blood
gushing out of her chest pouring down on my face. Some of it
even went into my mouth.</p>

<p>I look back and see it&#8217;s the police. No.. it&#8217;s not just the
police, it&#8217;s the RAB. The Rapid Action Battalion squad. They
responded to the distress signal and shot the lady.</p>
