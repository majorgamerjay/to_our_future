<p>The woman&#8217;s body fell on mine. Her blood splattered on my
chest. The blood kept flowing out and it didn&#8217;t stop. Her
eyes were turning cold and it was fading. Her body started
smelling like metallic substances and oil.</p>

<p>She whispered into my ear, &#8220;Please you have to die&#8221;</p>

<p>I got shocked again and replied, &#8220;what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you live, humanity will perish. Please die, this is my
last request&#8221;, she somehow whispered with all her strength.</p>

<p>I got so shocked that I threw her body aside and started
beating her with my hands, as if I am a mad man. A body
almost dying and it&#8217;s a woman, yet I am beating it. Blood
came coughing out of her and a one last strike from my hand
to her face, she died completely.</p>

<p><em>I can&#8217;t believe it, I murdered a person.</em></p>

<p>I started losing my sanity. I couldn&#8217;t believe I murdered
an almost dead and vulnerable person. I never did such a
cruel thing. This sin is something I will have to live by.
Why did she say that? Why?</p>

<p>I started to fall down in tears and screamed in pain. The
RAB took me to a nearby hospital to get me checked. The
amount of mental damage I got from that incident, is unbearable.</p>

<p>Please God, save me&#8230; from this pain&#8230;..</p>
