<h1 id="Faith">Faith</h1>

<p>I&#8217;m in the hospital. Recovering from the bruises I got from
that day. My eyes are still blurry and head is dizzy. But I
see lots of machines attached to my body. I thought I would
never see myself in this situation.</p>

<p>I got myself my own room here. That means I&#8217;m in the
ICU<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> or the CCU<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Did I get <em>that</em> injured during
the incident? I can&#8217;t remember straight.</p>

<p><em>*Door opens*</em></p>

<p>&#8220;Hello there, can you hear me?&#8221;</p>

<p>I try to nod but damn I got so many things attached to my
face, how am I even supposed to respond to that?</p>

<p>A semi-bold white person who looks like in their 50s entered
the room. Looks like a typical experienced doctor. Too typical
to the point it feels strange. It could just be my blurry vision
but I don&#8217;t know.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the doctor assigned to you. Your body sustained a lot
of damage from the incident that occured recently. Would you
like to elaborate on the incident?&#8221;</p>

<p>What? Why is this guy talking like a robot?</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Leave me a alone.&#8221; I gather all my strength to say
this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. You shall be sedated.&#8221;</p>

<p>What the hell is going on?!</p>
