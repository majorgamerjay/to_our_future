<p>The doctor then turns away to pull out a drawer from the
steel cabinet on side of the wall. At this point I realized,
this room has no doors. But how? The doctor came inside the
room through a door and now suddenly, there&#8217;s none!</p>

<p><em>Am I dreaming?!</em></p>

<p>The doctor pulls out a gun with a needle on the tip of it. I
guess that&#8217;s a syringe gun but why does he want to sedate
me?</p>

<p>I panic and try to break loose from the attachments but
something held me to the bed. I&#8217;m tired, I can&#8217;t even see
it. I have to think fast!</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Hasan, it is time for you to rest.&#8221; he says as he comes
forward slowly with the syringe gun.</p>

<p>As soon as he came besides me, I knocked the IV pole
that was beside me on him. It fell right on his head but he
didn&#8217;t even flinch.</p>

<p>At this point I&#8217;m convinced he&#8217;s not human. I&#8217;ve seen enough
crazy shit to know this is real and I&#8217;m going to get
killed silently through this sedative. I can&#8217;t trust what a
non-human like him says.</p>

<p>Everything slowly becomes dark and I start to feel numb. I
could hear my breathing but at the same time a faint smell
of something rotten.</p>

<p>I black out.</p>
