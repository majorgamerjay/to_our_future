<p>Oh god it hurts. Feels like something thick penetrated on
my right arm and it smells so bad. I can&#8217;t open my eyes but
I could hear someone saying my name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sami! Can you hear me?&#8221; Someone says my name</p>

<p>I open my eyes somehow and damn it felt like I slept and
opened my eyes after ages. I was in a room with people
around me.</p>

<p>I observe my surroundings first to see who&#8217;s who.. On my
right was a doctor wearing white coat, who looked like they
are in their 30s, a nurse is beside him holding a clipboard.</p>

<p><em>Doesn&#8217;t look cute.</em></p>

<p>On my left is my cousin, Mostafa. I could instantly
recognize him from his nerdy aura. To my surprise, he looked
like he was <em>actually</em> worried about me.</p>

<p>All this time I thought he was close to me because both him
and I are shut-ins.. well I technically was a shut-in but no
more and we played a lot of video games.</p>

<p>It could be that reason too for why he&#8217;s worried about me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dude, hello?? Can you hear me?&#8221; my cousin keeps making
sounds.</p>

<p>I nod at him.</p>
