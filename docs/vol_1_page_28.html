<p>I look at my right arm and see a needle connected to a
large IV bag. I assume it contains medicines or rehydration
saline. Whatever it is, it hurts and my throat feels sore.</p>

<p>The doctor tells my cousin something and then he hinted the
nurse to bring him something. I just remembered about the
robotic doctor and the room with no door. Wait, it was a
nightmare?</p>

<p>The nurse brings a normal syringe and a vial containing
something to the doctor.</p>

<p><em>No, it can&#8217;t be another sedative. I can&#8217;t handle all this
bullshit!</em></p>

<p>I start to panic seeing that. The doctor smiles and tries to
assure me it&#8217;s just a painkiller. I can&#8217;t believe him. I
lost my belief in a lot of things, now doctors too!</p>

<p>I pull my right hand like crazy even though it was binded to
the bed with velcos. The velco teared off and the needle
that&#8217;s connected to the vein started sucking in blood to the
IV pipe, the doctor brought another nurse and a person and
held me tight.</p>

<p>Then I saw the doctor turn a valve in the IV pipe and blood
stopped getting sucked out. Then I got calmed down because a
good doctor would stop that from happening right? He can&#8217;t
be bad.</p>
