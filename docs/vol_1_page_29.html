<p>Once I calmed down, the doctor again tries to assure me
about the injection. I am still wary about what other people
does to me. The maxim I live by, I can&#8217;t trust anybody. Not
even myself at this point.</p>

<p>But I gave up, everybody else here has the upper hand. They
can do whatever they want with me even if I don&#8217;t want them.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s alright, you can rest easy. This injection will
release pain and stiffness from your neck and shoulder&#8221; The
doctor says that to me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m starting to trust this doctor. He seems human enough with
all the crazy shit I have seen the last few months.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Monir. Moniruzzaman Azad is my full name. I know yours,
seen your patient card. Heh&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor sounds a lot more humane than the robotic doctor
in my dreams. All these delusional dreams I&#8217;m having, it
feels so surreal.</p>

<p>As the doctor administers the medicine with the syringe, I
start to feel feverish and start feeling some kind of
spicyness on my throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should rest for now. Mr. Amal, you don&#8217;t have to worry
about him. He&#8217;s in good hands now.&#8221; He says to my cousin.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention, his full name is Mostafa Bin Amal.</p>
