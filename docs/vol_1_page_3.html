<h1 id="Dreams">Dreams</h1>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; I was sleeping without any
shirts on. When I woke up from that nightmare, I was
sweating a lot. It made a side of the bed wet from sweat. I
say to myself,</p>

<p><em>I seriously should change my bedsheet</em></p>

<p>After I somehow got me calm after that truckload of BS nightmare,
I went over to the bathroom to fresh myself.</p>

<p>I have this bad habit of whenever I get tensed, I just go
to a nearby restroom and keep my face under the faucet.
One time it spooked the hell out of a guy who thought I
must&#8217;ve fell asleep; he poked me and when I
opened my eyes.. he got spooked.</p>

<p>That was hilarious and remembering that gave me a small giggle
on my way to the bathroom right now.</p>

<p>Time to do my daily routine.</p>
