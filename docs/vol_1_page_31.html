<p>I saw a button on my left side of the bed. Under it is a
small label that says <em>Emergency Button</em>. I press it
multiple times but no one came and the guy kept standing
beside me. He kept laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I disconnected the wire to the button. That won&#8217;t work
bro.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Is this guy nuts? Is this going to be my end? Getting
killed by a hooligan like him. I&#8217;m still a fucking virgin</em></p>

<p>I panic and try to get up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dude calm down, I ain&#8217;t gonna do anything to you.&#8221; The dude
says, &#8220;I&#8217;m Qabil. I came from the future lol&#8221;.</p>

<p>Did he just say &#8220;lol&#8221;? Who even says this? and he&#8217;s from the
future. For some reason, I&#8217;m still not surprised to have a
maniac like this guy beside me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry lol, I&#8217;m not gonna kill you or anything. I
heard the resistance agents attacked you. Didn&#8217;t you get the
message?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What message?&#8221;, I uttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hmm, did you have any cold, dark dreams before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah I did but I did not get anything related to this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess the Vision hasn&#8217;t developed much yet. The 400 years
conflict is still going on, so no wonder.&#8221;</p>

<p>What conflict? what &#8216;vision&#8217;? Is this guy crazy? also how
does he know about my dreams?</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry mate, I&#8217;ll explain everything to you later. For
now you gotta rest, I need to too. Have a nice night&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Have a nice night? IS this all you can come up in your
mind?</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;m tensed about this now. I can&#8217;t stop thinking about what
this guy said. <em>Have a nice night</em> this guy literally ruined
my sleep and now he wants me to have a nice night. What an
asshole.</p>
