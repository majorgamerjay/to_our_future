<p>The next morning I wake up. I need to go to the bathroom.
But how? I&#8217;m bed-rested right now. Okay no come to think of
it, all this time when I was in coma, who cleaned all my
uh.. things?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know where the toilet is. I&#8217;ll need some help going
there too as my body is tired.</p>

<p>I would&#8217;ve asked the guy beside me about where the toilet is
but he&#8217;s sleeping and snoring like an old man in his diapers
right now.</p>

<p>I got no choice but to click the emergency button. I take my
chance and click the button and I hear a ting. Looks like
the guy reconnected the wires back in.</p>

<p>I hope a hot lady nurse will come and will take me to the
bathroom. This is every degenerate incels&#8217; dream and I&#8217;m
proud to be one.</p>

<p>I could hear the footsteps of someone coming. It&#8217;s a nurse.
Not as hot or cute as I imagined but will do. Although she
has this grumpy look at me as if I&#8217;m staring at her breasts
which I totally am. Haven&#8217;t seen porn for the last few
months, the hell am I supposed to do!</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you need?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I need to go to the toilet. Can you take me there?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not supposed to get out of bed in this condition&#8221;</p>

<p>then she kicked out a small bucket from under my bed and
then said,</p>

<p>&#8220;You can do your stuff in this. You don&#8217;t have to worry
about anyone watching you. There&#8217;s a reason we put a curtain
between the units.&#8221;</p>

<p>Holy shit she&#8217;s grumpy as fuck. Typical women. I guess I&#8217;ll
have to make do with this. As I was doing my thing, only a
few moments passed by and then the curtain beside me got
pulled, the dude was about to say something until he saw me
pooping.</p>

<p>&#8220;WRONG TIME SORRY!&#8221; the dude rushed into his unit closing
the curtain. Holy shit he must&#8217;ve been disgusted by this. I
don&#8217;t know how the hell I&#8217;m gonna show my face after this.</p>

<p>Curse you bloody nurse!</p>
