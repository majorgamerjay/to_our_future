<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I used to be a shut-in before
I got into a college. I had this tendency to not go outside
although I never had any problem with it. I did most of my
stuff at home and rarely met with my &#8220;friends&#8221; at school.
They are more like classmates than friends.</p>

<p>The only reason I prefer calling them &#8220;friends&#8221; is because
they helped me develop from being a shut-in to a
semi-shut-in. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s a thing but to me, I
guess I got a few upgrades.</p>

<p><em>How am I still giggling?</em></p>

<p>My parents once considered to take me to a therapists or
maybe a psychologist. They said they will try to get me
treated so I can make some friends but I doubt that&#8217;s the
case. I think their intention is to get me diagnosed
whether I have autism or not. I think I may have autism but
I don&#8217;t know honestly. I just wish that I would get old and
a nice smooth job really fast.</p>
