<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I hear my roommate&#8217;s bed
creaking. He most probably woke up from me making giggling
sounds. He says I do it often than I realize and it&#8217;s
creepy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sami, you&#8217;re having a nightmare again bud?&#8221;, my friend
said to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, I guess so. I almost wet my bed this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You sure you didn&#8217;t wet your bed then? Because I smell shit
coming from your side.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Hmm, I do need to check whether I wet my bed or not.</em></p>

<p>I am an adult now, I can&#8217;t be wetting my bed at this age. I
go back to check if that happened, luckily I didn&#8217;t. It only
got wet from sweat which is usual for me since due to my
high metabolic activities inside my body. Did I say that
right? I don&#8217;t even know.</p>
