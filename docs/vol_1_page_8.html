<p>I rushed to the Sarah&#8217;s bathroom to get Rashed and as
soon as I reached there, I could hear giggles coming
from inside the room and a lot of thumping sounds as if
someone&#8217;s fighting something inside there. I tried to
open the door but it was locked.</p>

<p>I did what I am best at doing. Kicking doors. When I kicked
the door, I could hear a splash sound as if someone&#8217;s bone
just got broken, I see my friend in front of the door and he
pulled a short guy in full black from behind the door to him
and strangled him with his elbow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that?!&#8221; I yelled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know! This guy was hiding in the bathroom and
attacked me when I opened the door. This could be the one
who attacked Sarah!&#8221; Rashed replied.</p>

<p>The guy then started giggling. It was again creepy as fuck.
I couldn&#8217;t stand this and I kicked the guy in the balls and
he got knocked out.</p>

<p>We heard knocks from Sarah&#8217;s door. It was the paramedics
from the University&#8217;s clinic. We hid the guy in the bathroom
and took them to Sarah. They took her to the hospital.</p>
