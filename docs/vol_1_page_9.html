<p>&#8220;Check on the thief, Rashed. I&#8217;ll take care of her bed&#8221; I
said to Rashed.</p>

<p>Knowing the degenerate that I am, I got a lot of dirty
thoughts about the girl&#8217;s bed. I don&#8217;t want to blame myself
for this though, I always convinced my mind that this is what
all boys would&#8217;ve thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;The thief is still there, Sami.&#8221;</p>

<p>I went to the bathroom to take a closer look at the thief.
He wore a leather-like latex full material on his body. I
have never seen something like this before.</p>

<p><em>Why am I not calling the police?</em></p>

<p>&#8220;Dude, why didn&#8217;t we call the police yet?&#8221; I said to Rashed.</p>

<p>Rashed as usual, replied with &#8220;Based question. Yeah, I am
going to call the police&#8221;</p>

<p>This is a word he learnt from the internet. &#8220;Based&#8221;. The
hell does that even mean?</p>
