# Prologue

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's dark. The lights are
turned off. The room is cold. There's no one here. I don't
know what happened. Five minutes ago, I was outside, now I
am in a cold room with heavy air. I am sweating. The door is
right in front of me. I know it's not locked.

I muster up all my courage and go to the door; Once I twist
the doorknob, I get a feeling of strong wind pushing me on
the other side. There must be a storm outside, once I open
the door completely; I was shocked...

I am in an alley. Buildings in front of me are in rubbles.
It's broken; as if it's been broken for the last few
years. I look behind me and what I see is the backdoor of a
convenience store. So that can only mean, I woke up in a
storage room. I start asking myself questions,

*What happened here? Where is everybody? Where am I?*

I look for a sign. I need to find out where I am no matter
what. *Please help me God.* I keep saying this to myself.
