*\*Knock knock\**

My heart skipped a beat. Someone knocked at my door.
I get shocked now and then about mere stuff. Even when
someone knocks my door suddenly. Mostly because of that
incident.

"Come in!" I shouted

"Ree!!" Came in my two siblings, Raima and Zaima.

Both are twins. They are hella cute. If I could I would keep
poking at their cheeks for the whole day but that would be
weird and embarrassing.

"Vaiya, open this chips packet for me", Raima brought a
packet of potato chips with her. Since they are both 6 years
old, they still can't open a packet of chips properly. I
opened it up for them and took a piece.

"Hey that's unfair!" Zaima told me when I took a piece.

"Stop whining Zaima, it's fair because I am the one who
opened the packet"

"But you're an old guy!"

*Sheesh, can't believe I get called old more often now*
