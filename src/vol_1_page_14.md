I stopped having these nightmares I had back in dorm.

*Is it because I had a real life incident that's worse than
this nightmare?*

I keep asking myself these stupid questions. This only
proves how worthless and insecure I am about my life. But I
don't give a shit and I never gave a shit.

*\*Doorbell Rang\**

*We don't usually have any guests at home, who could that be?*

I look at the clock and it's 3:23 PM. My mom is supposed to
bring tea but I'm not gonna open the door. Then I hear my
mom opening the door and telling the guest to sit on the
sofa in the living room.

My mom said he brought my tea to the living room because the
guest wants to meet me. I don't like company and now I got a
guest.

*How worse can my day get now?*

I went to the living room and I was surprised.. It's Rashed.
