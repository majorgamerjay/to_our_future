Well I do really want to ask him what brings him here. But
that would be rude and last thing I want is to lose a
friend like this. Should I ask or not? I'm in a dilemma
here.

"So what brings you here, Rashed?"

"Oh yeah, I came to told you about Sarah and to visit. I
heard you guys have really good *pithas* here."

*Wait.. that was it? I thought it's gonna be dramatic and
he's gonna get mad at me. I also doubt you came here for that
you son of a bitch. You came here to flex your girlfriend, didn't you?*

"So how's Sarah?"

"She's good. Recovered mostly, the doctor said she will have
to stay for about 3 more weeks to fully recover. Oh, she
also said she's very thankful to you for taking care of her
during that incident."

"It's just my duty as a friend. No need for her to sweat
it."

*Holy shit, did she really thank me?*

"Well, I'll be off then. Thanks for the tea and
refreshments. We got some touring to do."

*Yeah, go on do your "touring" you bitch.*
