I heard my cousin Mostafa is going to get married. I guess
there is hope for that guy. He's a shut-in like me but he
didn't recover. He became internationally popular due to
his research papers about theoretical physics and got a lot
of money from organizations.

Cool thing about him is that he's a gamer. Heard he recently
bought the new game called Ultra Strike: Global Fire. I'm
going to visit him to get some games and food.

When I passed by 55th Roman Road, I started getting nausea
and headaches. The convenience store over there always
reminds me about that nightmare.

My dad once told me this road was named Roman Road
because there used to live a lot of Romaboos here in the
18th century despite the Roman's didn't exist at that time.
They praise their civilization, success and everything.

Like how Weaboos and Koreaboos exist, Romaboos exist. I
might get into this thing if someone who's into Roman
supremacy can help me.
