I stop at the local bus station and I pull out my phone.
First thing I see on Gwitter are pictures of Rashed and
his new girlfriend at the local tourist sites and food shop.

*What a hypocrite..*

Then, I felt something. Someone pulled something from my
backpocket. I look back and see a pickpocketer with my
wallet. I ran after him yelling everybody to stop him. He
started running very fast but in no way I am gonna lose my
Eid allowance.

***I WILL USE IT TO BUY ULTRA STRIKE: GLOBAL FIRE***

The pickpocketer ran into an alley. I know this place well
and that alley is a dead end. He fell into his own trap. But
at the same time I'm scared because what if the pickpocketer
has weapons? I am risking my life,

*Should I go?*

I opened my phone and dialed an emergency call to the police
about my location.
