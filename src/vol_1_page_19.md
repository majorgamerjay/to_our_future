By the time I reached that alley, the pickpocketer
disappeared.

*How did he disappear so fast?*

He couldn't have climbed the walls, it's very tall and
steep. But, when I looked up, I saw six guys hanging from
the roofs of the buildings with thick wires wearing the
same suit of the thief that attacked Sarah.

*No, this can't be!*

The two of them jump in front of the dead end the other
three blocked the opening to the road. The other one put
some kind of triangular device on the ground. It looked like
something from the future.

*Who are these guys?!*

One of them came towards me. The person's body looked like
that of a woman and so I assumed it's a she. If I did this
on the internet I might have gotten cancelled. Why am I even
thinking about this?

She came closer me and punched me in the face. I
fell on the ground and was about to shit my pants.

"Take whatever you want, please just don't kill me"
