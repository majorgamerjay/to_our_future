realized she was wearing high heels.

*How does she move like this wearing high heels?*

She started twisting her heels to inflict even more pain. I knew
I will never forget this pain. Felt like I already entered

helmet and a bunch of steam came out of it. Then she pulled it
off and there I saw. A face with black marks and scars on it but at
the same time symmetrical and like that of a cute petite.
Had an Asian-American shape. Her hair was short, most
probably because she had to fit it in within her helmet. She
took a long breath and then said,

"Shamiul Hasan, we are from the resistance and you have to die."
