After that incident, I had stopped talking to almost
everybody unless there was an important reason to. I stopped
going outside. I stopped all my contacts with friends. I
became a shut-in.

I was going through a very hard time. My parents noticed
this and took me to a psychiatrist who gave me pills that
would slow down my brain reactions.

This is to "calm myself" but in reality, this didn't
help me in any way. Soon I started having hallucinations
about things and I was always scared if what I see, becomes
real again.

This is why I kept myself at home most of the time as a kid
and a teen until I had to go to college.
