The woman's body fell on mine. Her blood splattered on my
chest. The blood kept flowing out and it didn't stop. Her
eyes were turning cold and it was fading. Her body started
smelling like metallic substances and oil.

She whispered into my ear, "Please you have to die"

I got shocked again and replied, "what?"

"If you live, humanity will perish. Please die, this is my
last request", she somehow whispered with all her strength.

I got so shocked that I threw her body aside and started
beating her with my hands, as if I am a mad man. A body
almost dying and it's a woman, yet I am beating it. Blood
came coughing out of her and a one last strike from my hand
to her face, she died completely.

*I can't believe it, I murdered a person.*

I started losing my sanity. I couldn't believe I murdered
an almost dead and vulnerable person. I never did such a
cruel thing. This sin is something I will have to live by.
Why did she say that? Why?

I started to fall down in tears and screamed in pain. The
RAB took me to a nearby hospital to get me checked. The
amount of mental damage I got from that incident, is unbearable.

Please God, save me... from this pain.....
