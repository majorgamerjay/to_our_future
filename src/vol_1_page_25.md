# Faith

I'm in the hospital. Recovering from the bruises I got from
that day. My eyes are still blurry and head is dizzy. But I
see lots of machines attached to my body. I thought I would
never see myself in this situation.

I got myself my own room here. That means I'm in the
ICU[^icu] or the CCU[^ccu]. Did I get *that* injured during
the incident? I can't remember straight.

*\*Door opens\**

"Hello there, can you hear me?"

I try to nod but damn I got so many things attached to my
face, how am I even supposed to respond to that?

A semi-bold white person who looks like in their 50s entered
the room. Looks like a typical experienced doctor. Too typical
to the point it feels strange. It could just be my blurry vision
but I don't know.

"I'm the doctor assigned to you. Your body sustained a lot
of damage from the incident that occured recently. Would you
like to elaborate on the incident?"

What? Why is this guy talking like a robot?

"No. Leave me a alone." I gather all my strength to say
this.

"Very well. You shall be sedated."

What the hell is going on?!

    that need emergency care.

[^ccu]:
    Critical Care Unit - One step above ICUs.
    It's for patients that are in critical conditions and
    near death situations.
