The doctor then turns away to pull out a drawer from the
steel cabinet on side of the wall. At this point I realized,
this room has no doors. But how? The doctor came inside the
room through a door and now suddenly, there's none!

*Am I dreaming?!*

The doctor pulls out a gun with a needle on the tip of it. I
guess that's a syringe gun but why does he want to sedate
me?

I panic and try to break loose from the attachments but
something held me to the bed. I'm tired, I can't even see
it. I have to think fast!

"Mr. Hasan, it is time for you to rest." he says as he comes
forward slowly with the syringe gun.

As soon as he came besides me, I knocked the IV pole
that was beside me on him. It fell right on his head but he
didn't even flinch.

At this point I'm convinced he's not human. I've seen enough
crazy shit to know this is real and I'm going to get
killed silently through this sedative. I can't trust what a
non-human like him says.

Everything slowly becomes dark and I start to feel numb. I
could hear my breathing but at the same time a faint smell
of something rotten.

I black out.
