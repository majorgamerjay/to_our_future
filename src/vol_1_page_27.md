Oh god it hurts. Feels like something thick penetrated on
my right arm and it smells so bad. I can't open my eyes but
I could hear someone saying my name.

"Sami! Can you hear me?" Someone says my name

I open my eyes somehow and damn it felt like I slept and
opened my eyes after ages. I was in a room with people
around me.

I observe my surroundings first to see who's who.. On my
right was a doctor wearing white coat, who looked like they
are in their 30s, a nurse is beside him holding a clipboard.

*Doesn't look cute.*

On my left is my cousin, Mostafa. I could instantly
recognize him from his nerdy aura. To my surprise, he looked
like he was *actually* worried about me.

All this time I thought he was close to me because both him
and I are shut-ins.. well I technically was a shut-in but no
more and we played a lot of video games.

It could be that reason too for why he's worried about me.

"Dude, hello?? Can you hear me?" my cousin keeps making
sounds.

I nod at him.
