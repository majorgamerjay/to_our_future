I look at my right arm and see a needle connected to a
large IV bag. I assume it contains medicines or rehydration
saline. Whatever it is, it hurts and my throat feels sore.

The doctor tells my cousin something and then he hinted the
nurse to bring him something. I just remembered about the
robotic doctor and the room with no door. Wait, it was a
nightmare?

The nurse brings a normal syringe and a vial containing
something to the doctor.

*No, it can't be another sedative. I can't handle all this
bullshit!*

I start to panic seeing that. The doctor smiles and tries to
assure me it's just a painkiller. I can't believe him. I
lost my belief in a lot of things, now doctors too!

I pull my right hand like crazy even though it was binded to
the bed with velcos. The velco teared off and the needle
that's connected to the vein started sucking in blood to the
IV pipe, the doctor brought another nurse and a person and
held me tight.

Then I saw the doctor turn a valve in the IV pipe and blood
stopped getting sucked out. Then I got calmed down because a
good doctor would stop that from happening right? He can't
be bad.
