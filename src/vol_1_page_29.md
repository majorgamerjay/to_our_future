Once I calmed down, the doctor again tries to assure me
about the injection. I am still wary about what other people
does to me. The maxim I live by, I can't trust anybody. Not
even myself at this point.

But I gave up, everybody else here has the upper hand. They
can do whatever they want with me even if I don't want them.

"It's alright, you can rest easy. This injection will
release pain and stiffness from your neck and shoulder" The
doctor says that to me.

I'm starting to trust this doctor. He seems human enough with
all the crazy shit I have seen the last few months.

"I'm Monir. Moniruzzaman Azad is my full name. I know yours,
seen your patient card. Heh"

The doctor sounds a lot more humane than the robotic doctor
in my dreams. All these delusional dreams I'm having, it
feels so surreal.

As the doctor administers the medicine with the syringe, I
start to feel feverish and start feeling some kind of
spicyness on my throat.

"You should rest for now. Mr. Amal, you don't have to worry
about him. He's in good hands now." He says to my cousin.

I forgot to mention, his full name is Mostafa Bin Amal.
