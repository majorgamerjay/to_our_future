# Dreams

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was sleeping without any
shirts on. When I woke up from that nightmare, I was
sweating a lot. It made a side of the bed wet from sweat. I
say to myself,

*I seriously should change my bedsheet*

After I somehow got me calm after that truckload of BS nightmare,
I went over to the bathroom to fresh myself.

I have this bad habit of whenever I get tensed, I just go
to a nearby restroom and keep my face under the faucet.
One time it spooked the hell out of a guy who thought I
must've fell asleep; he poked me and when I
opened my eyes.. he got spooked.

That was hilarious and remembering that gave me a small giggle
on my way to the bathroom right now.

Time to do my daily routine.
