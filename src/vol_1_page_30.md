As the doctor assured Mostafa about my safety, he told me I
will be okay and then left. I could see on my left the
window and on my right a series of other patients. Each bed
seperated by a thin paper-like white curtain through which
you can see silhoutte of other people.

The doctor also left and it started getting dark outside as
I could see the window on my left.

I could hear some sounds from the bed on my right, as if
someone just got out of bed. I could look at the silhoutte
of the person and he's facing towards me.

Am I getting into trouble again? Please no...

The person on that bed pulls the curtain to the side. I
could see him. A guy with wrinkled face, uneven teeth and
curly hair.

At first he looked at me like I'm some alien and then gave a
smile and then burst out into laughter.

*Is this guy crazy?*

This guy is laughing out loud at night when it's dark and
there are other patients in here. Does he have sense?
