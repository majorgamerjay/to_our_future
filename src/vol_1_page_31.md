I saw a button on my left side of the bed. Under it is a
small label that says *Emergency Button*. I press it
multiple times but no one came and the guy kept standing
beside me. He kept laughing.

"I disconnected the wire to the button. That won't work
bro."

*Is this guy nuts? Is this going to be my end? Getting
killed by a hooligan like him. I'm still a fucking virgin*

I panic and try to get up.

"Dude calm down, I ain't gonna do anything to you." The dude
says, "I'm Qabil. I came from the future lol".

Did he just say "lol"? Who even says this? and he's from the
future. For some reason, I'm still not surprised to have a
maniac like this guy beside me.

"Don't worry lol, I'm not gonna kill you or anything. I
heard the resistance agents attacked you. Didn't you get the
message?"

"What message?", I uttered.

"Hmm, did you have any cold, dark dreams before?"

"Yeah I did but I did not get anything related to this."

"I guess the Vision hasn't developed much yet. The 400 years
conflict is still going on, so no wonder."

What conflict? what 'vision'? Is this guy crazy? also how
does he know about my dreams?

"Don't worry mate, I'll explain everything to you later. For
now you gotta rest, I need to too. Have a nice night"

*Have a nice night? IS this all you can come up in your
mind?*

I'm tensed about this now. I can't stop thinking about what
this guy said. *Have a nice night* this guy literally ruined
my sleep and now he wants me to have a nice night. What an
asshole.
