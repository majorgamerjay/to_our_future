&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to be a shut-in before
I got into a college. I had this tendency to not go outside
although I never had any problem with it. I did most of my
stuff at home and rarely met with my "friends" at school.
They are more like classmates than friends.

The only reason I prefer calling them "friends" is because
they helped me develop from being a shut-in to a
semi-shut-in. I don't know if that's a thing but to me, I
guess I got a few upgrades.

*How am I still giggling?*

My parents once considered to take me to a therapists or
maybe a psychologist. They said they will try to get me
treated so I can make some friends but I doubt that's the
case. I think their intention is to get me diagnosed
whether I have autism or not. I think I may have autism but
I don't know honestly. I just wish that I would get old and
a nice smooth job really fast.
