&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear my roommate's bed
creaking. He most probably woke up from me making giggling
sounds. He says I do it often than I realize and it's
creepy.

"Sami, you're having a nightmare again bud?", my friend
said to me.

"Yeah, I guess so. I almost wet my bed this time."

"You sure you didn't wet your bed then? Because I smell shit
coming from your side."

*Hmm, I do need to check whether I wet my bed or not.*

I am an adult now, I can't be wetting my bed at this age. I
go back to check if that happened, luckily I didn't. It only
got wet from sweat which is usual for me since due to my
high metabolic activities inside my body. Did I say that
right? I don't even know.
