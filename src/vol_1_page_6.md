*\*giggles\**

"Dude, I told you not to do that in the dark. That's creepy
as hell.", my friend shouted from his bed.

"Do what? I didn't do anything."

"Yes, you did. You just giggled like a creepy fucker again."

*Is he messing with me?*

"What? Are you serious?"

This is weird. Usually when I giggle, I notice that I
giggled although it's not in my control. I turn on the
lights to check if something's wrong.

*screams*

"What the hell?! Where did that scream come from?", my
friend yelled.
