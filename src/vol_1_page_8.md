I rushed to the Sarah's bathroom to get Rashed and as
soon as I reached there, I could hear giggles coming
from inside the room and a lot of thumping sounds as if
someone's fighting something inside there. I tried to
open the door but it was locked.

I did what I am best at doing. Kicking doors. When I kicked
the door, I could hear a splash sound as if someone's bone
just got broken, I see my friend in front of the door and he
pulled a short guy in full black from behind the door to him
and strangled him with his elbow.

"Who's that?!" I yelled.

"I don't know! This guy was hiding in the bathroom and
attacked me when I opened the door. This could be the one
who attacked Sarah!" Rashed replied.

The guy then started giggling. It was again creepy as fuck.
I couldn't stand this and I kicked the guy in the balls and
he got knocked out.

We heard knocks from Sarah's door. It was the paramedics
from the University's clinic. We hid the guy in the bathroom
and took them to Sarah. They took her to the hospital.
