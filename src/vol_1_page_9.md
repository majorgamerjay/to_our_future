"Check on the thief, Rashed. I'll take care of her bed" I
said to Rashed.

Knowing the degenerate that I am, I got a lot of dirty
thoughts about the girl's bed. I don't want to blame myself
for this though, I always convinced my mind that this is what
all boys would've thought.

"The thief is still there, Sami."

I went to the bathroom to take a closer look at the thief.
He wore a leather-like latex full material on his body. I
have never seen something like this before.

*Why am I not calling the police?*

"Dude, why didn't we call the police yet?" I said to Rashed.

Rashed as usual, replied with "Based question. Yeah, I am
going to call the police"

This is a word he learnt from the internet. "Based". The
hell does that even mean?
